# Write Your First Agentic Workflow

_Writing your first workflow is the moment theory becomes practice — let's make something real._

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll create `.github/workflows/daily-report-status.md`, a small workflow that reads repository issues and posts one controlled response.

In either path, you'll start with `daily-report-status.md` and end with `daily-report-status.lock.yml`, the compiled workflow that GitHub Actions runs.

## 📋 Before You Start

- Completed [Install the gh-aw CLI Extension](06-install-gh-aw.md)
- You can use `gh aw` in a terminal or open GitHub Copilot for a browser-based session

## Choose Your Path

| Path | What you'll do | Continue |
|---|---|---|
| **Terminal path** | Build the workflow incrementally in two short parts, compile after each meaningful change, then commit and push | [Write the workflow with the Terminal path](07a-your-first-workflow-terminal.md) |
| **GitHub Copilot path** | Ask an agent in GitHub Copilot or the repository's **Agents** tab to create and validate the workflow, then review and merge its pull request | [Write the workflow with GitHub Copilot](07c-your-first-workflow-copilot.md) |

The Terminal path gives you early [compiler](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/compilation-process/) feedback. The GitHub Copilot path delegates `gh aw compile` to the agent's session workspace, so browser-first learners can still complete this step without a local terminal.
