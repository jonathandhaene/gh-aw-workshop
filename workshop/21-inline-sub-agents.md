    The existing curriculum covers MCP tools, shared workflow [reuse](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/guides/reusing-workflows/), persistent memory, and conditional logic — but nothing on how to decompose a workflow into multiple agents within a single file. Learners who follow the full path end up with one monolithic prompt running on an expensive frontier model even for trivial per-item tasks. This step closes that gap by introducing the planner-worker pattern.

# Split Complex Workflows with [Inline Sub-Agents](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/inline-sub-agents/)

> _One workflow file, multiple specialised agents — each doing exactly one thing, at the right cost._

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll add a sub-agent to your daily-status workflow so the parent agent can stay focused on planning and final writing while a focused sub-agent handles one repeated task. By the end of this step, your workflow will be easier to scale without turning the whole prompt into one long, repetitive brief.

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have a working agentic workflow from the build steps ([Step 11a](07-your-first-workflow.md) or equivalent).
- You understand YAML [frontmatter](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/) from [Write Your First Agentic Workflow](07-your-first-workflow.md).
- You know how to compile a workflow from [Side Quest: Using `gh aw compile` to Catch Errors Early](side-quest-07-01-compile-workflow.md).

## Understand the parent agent and sub-agent split

When your workflow repeats the same small job for many items, keep the parent agent focused on the overall plan and final output. Move the repeated item-by-item work into a sub-agent.

A sub-agent is just a helper you define inside the same workflow file. In this step, you only need one syntax rule: start the helper with a level-2 heading that begins with `## agent:` and a backtick-wrapped name. Put the helper brief under that heading. If you want, add a short frontmatter block with fields such as `description` or `model`. Then call that helper by name from the parent workflow brief.

> 🤔 **Predict:** Look at your current workflow. Which instruction repeats once per issue, pull request, or file? Keep that answer in mind for the next section.

> Want the full rules for names, frontmatter, model aliases, and block placement? See the existing [Side Quest: Sub-Agent Syntax Reference](side-quest-21-01-sub-agent-syntax.md). Stay on this page if you only want the main path.

## Apply the pattern to your workflow

### Pick one repeated task

Open your workflow file and choose one bounded task that repeats for each item, such as summarizing one issue or classifying one pull request.

**Action:** Before you edit, choose these two things:

- the sub-agent name you want to use
- the one-sentence job that sub-agent should do

### Add one sub-agent block

After your parent workflow brief, at the bottom of the file, add a sub-agent block like this:

```markdown
## agent: `issue-summarizer`
---
description: Summarizes a single open issue in one sentence
model: small
---

Read the title and body of one GitHub issue. Return exactly one sentence
that explains what the issue is asking for and its current status.
```

Keep the sub-agent brief narrow. If it processes one item at a time and returns a single result, it belongs here.

### Update the parent workflow brief to call the sub-agent

In the parent workflow brief, tell the parent agent when to use the sub-agent:

```markdown
You produce a daily repository health digest.

1. Fetch all open issues (title, body, number).
2. For each issue, use the `issue-summarizer` agent to produce a
   one-sentence summary.
3. Compile the summaries into a numbered list, ordered by issue number.
4. Post the list as a comment on the repository's main tracking issue.
```

**Action:** Change one broad instruction in the parent workflow brief into a direct sub-agent call by name. For example:

- Before: "Summarize all issues."
- After: "For each issue, use the `issue-summarizer` agent."

That pattern tells the parent agent to loop over the items, collect one result from the sub-agent for each item, and then combine those results in the next step.

### Compile and check the result

From the repository root, run:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want faster feedback while editing, run `gh aw compile --watch` in a second terminal.

The compile should finish without errors and regenerate your workflow's `.lock.yml` file.

### Run and verify

Trigger a manual run. In the Actions log, confirm the parent agent calls your sub-agent and then uses the sub-agent result in the final summary.

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] You identified one repeated task in your workflow that fits a sub-agent
- [ ] You wrote a sub-agent name and one-sentence job before editing the file
- [ ] Your workflow file now includes at least one `## agent: \`name\`` block
- [ ] You updated the main brief to call the sub-agent by name
- [ ] `gh aw compile` completed without errors
- [ ] Your workflow's `.lock.yml` file was regenerated after the compile
- [ ] A manual run completed and the Actions log showed the sub-agent being called
- [ ] The final workflow output used the sub-agent result
