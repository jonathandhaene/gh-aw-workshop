# Write Your First Agentic Workflow — Terminal Path

_Writing your first workflow is the moment theory becomes practice — let's make something real._

> [!NOTE]
> Want to work without a terminal? Switch to the [GitHub Copilot path](07c-your-first-workflow-copilot.md).

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll create the first version of `.github/workflows/daily-report-status.md` with just two [frontmatter](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/) fields:

- `name` (workflow label)
- `on.schedule` (manual trigger)

Then you'll run your first compile check.

## 📋 Before You Start

- Completed [Install the gh-aw CLI Extension](06-install-gh-aw.md)
- The `gh aw` command works in your terminal
- You already ran `gh aw init` and pushed `.github/skills/agentic-workflows/`

## Steps

### Create the workflows directory

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Create your first workflow file

```bash
touch .github/workflows/daily-report-status.md
```

Open `.github/workflows/daily-report-status.md` in your editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This `.md` file is **not** the workflow GitHub Actions executes. You write the goal in Markdown; `gh aw compile` generates the `.lock.yml` file that Actions actually runs.

### Add the starter frontmatter

Paste this at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
name: Daily Report Status
on:
  schedule: daily
---
```

- `name` is what you see in the Actions UI.
- `schedule: daily` means it triggers once a day. The compiler automatically adds the [`workflow_dispatch`](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/) event as well.

![How workflow_dispatch works: author the .md file, compile to a lock.yml, push to GitHub, then click Run workflow in the Actions tab to trigger the agent](images/07a-workflow-dispatch-trigger.svg)

### Run your first compile check

```bash
gh aw compile
```

Expected result:

You see a green success message and a generated `.lock.yml` file next to `daily-report-status.md`.

If you hit an error, use [Side Quest: Using `gh aw compile` to Catch Errors Early](side-quest-07-01-compile-workflow.md).


## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] The `.github/workflows/` directory exists in your repository
- [ ] `.github/workflows/daily-report-status.md` exists and is open in your editor
- [ ] The file contains a `name:` field and an `on.schedule:` field in the frontmatter block (between the `---` fences)
- [ ] You ran `gh aw compile` successfully and it generated `daily-report-status.lock.yml` next to the `.md` file
