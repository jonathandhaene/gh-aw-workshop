## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll do a fast refresher on the Actions primitives used in this workshop: [triggers](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/), jobs, steps, and workflow files. After this step, you'll be able to read any classic GitHub Actions workflow file.

## 📋 Before You Start

- Practice repository is set up from a previous step.
- No tools or credentials needed for this step.

## Quick Refresher

A GitHub Actions workflow is a YAML file in `.github/workflows/` that tells GitHub:

- _when_ to run (`on`)
- _what_ to run (`jobs`)
- _how_ each job executes (`steps`)

```text
.github/
  workflows/
    hello.yml   ← each workflow file lives here
```

Annotated example — each comment names the key term (this is a standard Actions workflow, not an agentic workflow):

```yaml
# Standard GitHub Actions workflow — not an agentic workflow
name: Hello Workflow

on: workflow_dispatch         # trigger: the event that starts this workflow

jobs:
  hello:                      # job: a named group of steps on one machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # runner: the machine GitHub provisions for this job
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions"   # step: a shell command on the runner
```

<details>
<summary>What is a runner?</summary>

A **runner** is the machine GitHub provisions for each job — fresh and isolated for every run.

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # also: windows-latest, macos-latest
```

You can also bring a **[self-hosted runner](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/self-hosted-runners/)** for custom hardware or private networks. Agentic workflows use the same hosted runners.

## Why This Matters for Agentic Workflows

Traditional workflows execute a fixed script path. Agentic workflows still use the same Actions foundation, but introduce AI-driven decision making inside that runtime.

## Label a sample workflow

The diagram below shows how the five key parts fit together in every workflow file.

![GitHub Actions workflow anatomy: trigger, job, runner, steps, and actions shown as nested layers](images/04-actions-anatomy.svg)

Before reading on, label each highlighted part of the workflow below with its type:
`trigger`, `job`, `runner`, `step`, or `action`.

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "All checks passed"
```

- [ ] I labeled `on: [push]`
- [ ] I labeled `test:` (the job name under `jobs:`)
- [ ] I labeled `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- [ ] I labeled `uses: actions/checkout@v4`
- [ ] I labeled `run: echo "All checks passed"`

<details>
<summary>Reveal the labels</summary>

- `on: [push]` → **trigger** (when this workflow runs)
- `jobs: test:` → **job** (a group of steps that runs on one machine)
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → **runner** (the machine type GitHub provisions)
- `uses: actions/checkout@v4` → **action** (a reusable step from the Actions marketplace)
- `run: echo "All checks passed"` → **step** (a shell command run directly on the runner)

</details>

## Try it: Explore a real workflow

Open a real workflow file and find the three core building blocks — no terminal or credentials required, just your browser.

1. Open any public repository on GitHub (for example, the [gh-aw-workshop](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw-workshop) repository).
2. Click the **Actions** tab.
3. Click any workflow in the left sidebar.
4. Click **View workflow file** (top right of the run list).
5. In the YAML, find and note:
   - The `on:` trigger — what event starts this workflow?
   - One `jobs:` entry — what is the job named?
   - One `steps` item — what command does it run?

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] I can identify `on`, `jobs`, and `steps` in a workflow file
- [ ] I labeled all five parts of the sample workflow above (trigger, job, runner, action, step)
- [ ] I know workflows live in `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] I explored a real workflow and found its trigger, a job name, and a step command
- [ ] I answered the check-your-understanding questions
- [ ] I can continue to Step 5, or skip ahead to Step 6 if I already know this material

> [!TIP]
> This step covers several new terms quickly. If anything feels unclear — runner, trigger, action — the [gh-aw glossary](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/glossary/) defines each one in a sentence. Bookmark it and return whenever you hit an unfamiliar term later in the workshop.
