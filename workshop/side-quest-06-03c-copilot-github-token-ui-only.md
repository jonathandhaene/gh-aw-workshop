# Side Quest: Method 2 (UI-only) — COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN Secret

> _Optional: this is the GitHub UI-friendly variant of Method 2. Use it when you prefer or need to complete personal-billing setup without terminal commands._

This method stores a fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) as a repository secret named `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. The [agentic workflow](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) engine picks it up automatically.

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have a GitHub account with an active Copilot subscription.
- You have read [Side Quest: Configure GitHub Copilot Authentication](side-quest-06-03-copilot-token.md) and chosen Method 2.

## ✏️ Sub-exercise A: Generate the token

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click **Generate new token (fine-grained)**.
2. Name the token (for example, gh-aw-copilot) and set an expiry (90 days is a common default). Set a reminder so you rotate the token before it expires.
3. Set **Repository access** based on your workshop repository visibility:
   - For a public repository, choose **Public repositories**.
   - For a private repository, choose **Only select repositories** and pick your repository.
4. Under [Permissions](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/permissions/) → **Account permissions**, set Copilot requests to Read-only.
5. Click **Generate token** and copy the value immediately. GitHub shows it only once.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copy the token before you navigate away or close the tab. If you miss this window, you must generate a new token.

**Verify:** The token value is visible on screen and copied to your clipboard before continuing.

Quick check:

- [ ] I can see a newly created PAT in my token list
- [ ] I copied the token value before leaving the page
- [ ] I noted the token expiry date

## ✏️ Sub-exercise B: Store the secret

Open your repository in a new tab so you keep the token page open until the secret is saved.

1. In your repository, open **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
2. Click **New repository secret**.
3. Enter the name `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (uppercase with underscores).
4. Paste the token value and verify no extra spaces were added before or after the token string.
5. Click **Add secret**.
6. Confirm the secret appears in the list as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**Verify:** `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` appears in the Secrets list — then you can safely close the token tab.

Quick check:

- [ ] The secret name is exactly `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- [ ] The secret now appears in the repository Actions secrets list
- [ ] I closed the token tab only after confirming the secret was saved

## Select the token in your workflow

1. Edit the source workflow and remove `copilot-requests: write`.
2. Commit the source change.
3. Ask the **Agentic Workflows** agent to run `gh aw compile` and commit the updated [lock file](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#workflow-lock-file-lockyml).

When `copilot-requests: write` is present, the workflow ignores `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` for inference.

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] You generated a new fine-grained PAT and copied it before leaving the token page
- [ ] The token has **Copilot requests: Read-only** under **Account permissions**
- [ ] `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` exists in **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- [ ] `copilot-requests: write` is not present in the source workflow
- [ ] The agent recompiled and committed the updated lock file
- [ ] You set a reminder to rotate the PAT before the expiry date
- [ ] You understand when to use Method 1 vs Method 2 (use the [auth overview](side-quest-06-03-copilot-token.md) if needed)
