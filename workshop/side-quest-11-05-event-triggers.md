# Side Quest: Event-Driven Triggers in Agentic Workflows

> _Optional: use this primer if you want help choosing between [scheduled](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/#scheduled-triggers-schedule) and event-driven workflows before you finish [Build — PR Code Reviewer](15-conditional-logic.md), then return to the main adventure._

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll compare scheduled and event-driven [triggers](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/), copy four starter trigger blocks, and learn how trigger choice affects `safe-outputs`. By the end you'll know when to reach for `pull_request`, `push`, `issues`, or `schedule`.

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have an existing workflow file from Step 11a or Step 11c, such as `.github/workflows/daily-status.md`.
- You know how to commit and push changes in your chosen path.

## Scheduled vs event-driven triggers

A **scheduled** workflow runs because the clock says it is time. An **event-driven** workflow runs because something happened in the repository, like a pull request opening or an issue being reopened.

| Trigger style | What starts it | Good fit |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Scheduled | Time passes | Daily summaries, reminders, audits |
| Event-driven | A GitHub event happens | PR review, issue triage, post-push follow-up |

If you want the workflow to react to a specific repository action, use an event trigger. If you want it to run even when nobody touched the repo, use a schedule.

## Four common trigger patterns

### `pull_request`

Use this when the workflow should react to pull request activity.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```

This is a good fit when you want feedback tied to the current PR, like the PR Code Reviewer in Step 11c.

### `push`

Use this when the workflow should react as soon as commits land on a branch.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```

This is a good fit when you want to check or summarize changes after code is pushed.

### `issues`

Use this when the workflow should react to issue activity.

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```

This is a good fit when you want an assistant to triage, label, or reply when someone opens an issue.

### `schedule`

Use this when the workflow should run on a clock, whether or not anyone touched the repository.

```yaml
on:
  schedule: daily
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```

This is a good fit for recurring reports like the Daily Repo Status workflow in Step 11a.

## Try It: Swap Your Trigger

Open your workflow file, such as `.github/workflows/daily-status.md`, and replace the existing `on:` block with `workflow_dispatch` plus one event trigger from this page.

Then:

1. Save the workflow file with your updated trigger block.
2. Run [`gh aw compile`](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/compilation-process/) to verify the change is valid.
3. Commit and push the change using your chosen path.
4. Open the workflow in the GitHub Actions UI, trigger it manually, and confirm it runs.

## How trigger choice changes `safe-outputs`

The trigger decides **when** the workflow starts. The [safe-outputs](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) block decides **where it is allowed to write back**.

| Trigger | Natural thing to reply to | Common `safe-outputs` choice |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `pull_request` | The current pull request | `add-comment` |
| `issues` | The current issue | `add-comment` |
| `push` | Often no built-in conversation thread | Usually none at first, or `add-comment` if the workflow posts to an issue or PR it finds |
| `schedule` | Usually a standing issue or report thread | `add-comment` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The trigger does **not** automatically grant write access. You still need to choose the right `safe-outputs` entry for the place you want the agent to write.

## Three questions to pick the right trigger

Ask yourself:

1. **What exactly should wake this workflow up?**
2. **Is there already a pull request or issue for the agent to reply to?**
3. **Should the workflow still run even if nobody changed anything?**

Use this rule of thumb:

- If the answer is "a PR changed," start with `pull_request`.
- If the answer is "a commit landed," start with `push`.
- If the answer is "an issue changed," start with `issues`.
- If the answer is "nothing happened, but I still want a report," start with `schedule`.

## Concrete example: Step 11a vs Step 11c

The Daily Repo Status workflow in [Step 11a](07-your-first-workflow.md) and the PR Code Reviewer in [Step 11c](15-conditional-logic.md) use the same workflow format, but they solve different timing problems.

| Step | Trigger | Why it fits | Safe output |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 11a Daily Repo Status | `schedule: daily` | You want a report every day, even on quiet days | `add-comment` |
| 11c PR Code Reviewer | `pull_request: {}` | You want feedback only when a PR changes | `add-comment` |

That is the core decision: pick the trigger that matches the moment you care about, then pick the write target that matches the object you want the workflow to answer.

<!-- journey: all -->
## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] I can explain the difference between a scheduled workflow and an event-driven workflow
- [ ] I know starter trigger blocks for `pull_request`, `push`, `issues`, and `schedule`
- [ ] I changed my workflow's trigger and confirmed it still compiles with `gh aw compile`
- [ ] I understand that `safe-outputs` controls write access separately from the trigger
- [ ] I can explain why both Step 11a and Step 11c use `add-comment` as their `safe-outputs` choice
