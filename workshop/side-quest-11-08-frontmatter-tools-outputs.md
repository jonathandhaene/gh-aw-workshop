# Side Quest: [Frontmatter](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/) Deep Dive — Part B

> _Optional continuation of [Part A](side-quest-11-01-frontmatter-deep-dive.md): covers tools, [safe-outputs](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/), the closing fence, and the agent body. Return to the main path when done._

## 📋 Before You Start

You have completed [Part A](side-quest-11-01-frontmatter-deep-dive.md) and your draft file already includes `emoji`, `on:`, and `permissions:`.

---

## Section 4 — `tools:`

**🔍 Predict:** To let the agent call GitHub APIs securely and stay within the [permissions](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/permissions/) you declared, what configuration would you add? Write your answer before reading on.

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    mode: gh-proxy
    toolsets: [default]
```

**What this section does:** Declares which external tool servers the agent may call during its run.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tools:` | Declares every tool server the agent is allowed to call. At least one entry is required for an agent that reads GitHub data. |
| `github:` | Connects the agent to the [GitHub MCP server](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/tools/) so it can query issues, pull requests, commits, and workflow runs. |
| `mode: gh-proxy` | Routes every GitHub API call through a proxy that enforces the `permissions:` you declared, blocking any call you have not pre-approved. |
| `toolsets: [default]` | Activates the standard GitHub toolset covering issues, pull requests, commits, and Actions runs. |

**✏️ Try it:** Add the `tools:` block to your draft file. Double-check that `mode` and `toolsets` are indented under `github:`.

---

## Section 5 — `safe-outputs:`

**🔍 Predict:** You want the agent to post exactly one comment per run and nothing else. What would you write under `safe-outputs`?

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
    max: 1
```

**What this section does:** Lists every write action the agent is allowed to perform. Any write operation not listed here is blocked at runtime, regardless of what the agent body requests.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `safe-outputs:` | Declares every write operation the agent may perform. Any write not listed here is silently blocked. |
| `add-comment:` | Permits the agent to post a comment on an issue or pull request. |
| `max: 1` | Caps the operation at one comment per run. A second attempt is silently dropped. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without `safe-outputs`, the agent cannot write anything — even if you ask it to in the body. The YAML frontmatter is the source of truth for write access, not the prose instructions.

**✏️ Try it:** Add `safe-outputs` to your draft. Verify that `max: 1` is indented under `add-comment:`.

---

## Section 6 — Closing fence

**🔍 Predict:** How does the file parser know where the YAML configuration ends and the agent's instructions begin?

```yaml
---
```

**What this section does:** Closes the [YAML frontmatter](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/) block. Everything below this line is the Markdown body — the agent's plain-English task brief.

**✏️ Try it:** Add the closing `---` to your draft. Confirm the file now has exactly two `---` fences.

---

## Section 7 — The Markdown body

**🔍 Predict:** The agent must collect four data points from the repository. What four things would you list?

```markdown
# Daily Repo Status Report

You are an AI assistant that monitors this repository and posts a concise daily health report.

## Your Task

Collect and summarize:
1. **Open pull requests** — count, and flag any open longer than 7 days
2. **Open issues** — total count, how many are labeled "bug"
3. **CI status** — result of the most recent workflow run on the default branch
4. **Last commit** — message and time since it was pushed

## Guidelines

- Post only one comment per run. If you have already posted today, skip.
- Keep the report factual. Do not invent numbers.
- If no open issue exists, create one titled "Daily Status Reports" and post the first comment there.
```

**What this section does:** This is the plain-English brief the AI agent reads at runtime — a job description telling it what to collect and how to respond.

Three conventions keep a task brief reliable:

- **A title and role statement** anchor the agent's purpose at the very top of the body.
- **A numbered task list** helps the agent work through each data point in a predictable order.
- **A guidelines block** handles edge cases — such as "already posted today" — so the agent does not have to guess.

**✏️ Try it:** Add the body below the closing `---` in your draft file, then run `gh aw compile` to check for errors.

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] You can explain what `mode: gh-proxy` does and why it matters for security
- [ ] You understand that `safe-outputs` is the only source of write access — not the body text
- [ ] Your draft file has two `---` fences with the agent body below the second
- [ ] The agent body contains a title, a numbered task list, and a guidelines block
- [ ] The file compiles without errors
