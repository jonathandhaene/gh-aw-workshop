    Every existing step produces stateless workflows that start fresh on each run. Real automation needs
    cross-run state: deduplication, baseline comparison, and incremental scanning. The gh-aw docs describe
    two production-ready primitives for this — cache-memory and repo-memory — but nothing in the workshop
    covered them. This step closes that gap.

# Make Your Workflow Remember Across Runs

> _A workflow that forgets everything after each run will repeat itself. Give it memory and it can act only on what's new._

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll add [persistent memory](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/patterns/memory-ops/) to your agentic workflow so it can carry state between runs. By the end of this step, your workflow will remember what it has already reported on and skip duplicates — so your team never gets the same alert twice.

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have a working agentic workflow from the build steps ([Step 11a](07-your-first-workflow.md) or equivalent).
- You are comfortable editing YAML frontmatter from [Give Your Agent More Tools with MCP](17-add-mcp-tools.md).
- You understand how `safe-outputs` controls write access (see [Side Quest: Frontmatter Deep Dive — Part B](side-quest-11-08-frontmatter-tools-outputs.md) if you need a refresher).

## Why Memory Matters

Every workflow run you have built so far starts with a blank slate. That is fine for a daily summary, but it causes problems the moment you want to:

- **Deduplicate alerts** — alert only on _new_ open issues, not the same ones every morning.
- **Compare against a baseline** — "did the number of failing tests increase since yesterday?"
- **Scan incrementally** — skip pull requests you have already reviewed.

You will use `cache-memory` in this step; see [Side Quest: Choosing Between Cache Memory and Repo Memory](side-quest-20-01-memory-patterns.md) for a full comparison.

## Steps

### Choose the right memory tool

For this deduplication use case, `cache-memory` is the right choice.

### Add `cache-memory` to your frontmatter

Open your workflow file at `.github/workflows/daily-status.md`. Add `cache-memory` inside the `tools:` block in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Daily Status Report
on:
  schedule: daily
  workflow_dispatch: {}
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: daily-status-seen-issues
    ttl: 7d
---
```

What each field does:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tools:` | Parent key that enables tool integrations for this workflow. Memory primitives are nested under this key. |
| `cache-memory:` | Tells `gh-aw` to back this memory slot with the [GitHub Actions](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/guides/github-actions-primer/) cache. Nested under `tools:`. |
| `key:` | A unique name for this memory slot. Prefix it with your workflow name to avoid collisions if you have multiple workflows in the same repository. |
| `ttl: 7d` | How long to keep cached data without a refresh. After 7 days of no runs the cache expires and the agent starts fresh. |

### Update your task brief to use the memory

Below the frontmatter, tell the agent how to use its memory. The agent reads and writes the memory slot by name:

```markdown
You monitor this repository for newly opened issues and post a daily digest.

Use your `daily-status-seen-issues` memory to track which issue numbers you
have already reported on. On each run:

1. Fetch all currently open issues.
2. Filter out any issue numbers that appear in your memory.
3. If there are new issues, post a comment on the tracking issue listing only
   the new ones.
4. Add the new issue numbers to your memory so you skip them next time.
5. If there are no new issues, post nothing.
```

> [!TIP]
> Be explicit in the brief about _reading_ and _writing_ the memory. The agent will not automatically persist anything unless you ask it to in the task brief.

### Compile and validate

After editing the frontmatter, compile the workflow to confirm the memory block is valid:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

Fix any errors before pushing. Common mistakes include putting `cache-memory:` at the top level instead of nesting it under `tools:`, and omitting the `key:` field for `cache-memory`.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--watch` to recompile automatically as you edit: `gh aw compile --watch`

### Push your change and initialize the cache

Push your workflow update:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/daily-status.md .github/workflows/daily-status.lock.yml
git commit -m "feat: add cache-memory deduplication to daily-status"
git push
```

1. Trigger a manual run in **Actions → Daily Status Report → Run workflow**.
2. Open the run log and confirm it contains `cache-memory: loaded 0 items`. This confirms the cache starts empty and initializes correctly.

### Trigger a second run and confirm memory reuse

1. Trigger the workflow a second time with no new issues.
2. Open the second run log and find `cache-memory: loaded N items`.
3. Confirm `N` matches the number of issues processed in the first run.

### Test deduplication with a new issue

1. Open a new issue in your practice repository.
2. Trigger the workflow again.
3. Confirm the run reports only the new issue.

> [!TIP]
> Open the run log for the second run and look for a line where the agent reads its memory. You will see the stored issue numbers that it filters against — that's your workflow remembering across runs.

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] Your workflow frontmatter has `cache-memory:` nested under `tools:`
- [ ] Your task brief explicitly tells the agent to read and write the named memory slot
- [ ] `gh aw compile` passes with no errors
- [ ] The first manual run log includes `cache-memory: loaded 0 items`
- [ ] The second run log includes `cache-memory: loaded N items`, and `N` matches the number of items from the first run
- [ ] After opening a new issue and running again, only the new issue is reported
