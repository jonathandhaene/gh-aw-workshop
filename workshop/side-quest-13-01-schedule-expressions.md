# Side Quest: Fuzzy [Schedule](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/#scheduled-triggers-schedule) Expressions

> _Optional: use this quick reference if you want help choosing a schedule expression for [Schedule It to Run Every Day](12-test-and-iterate.md), then return to the main adventure._

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have completed [Schedule It to Run Every Day](12-test-and-iterate.md) or are working through it now.
- You understand that [GitHub Actions](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/) schedules use **[cron](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/) expressions** (e.g., `0 9 * * 1` runs at 09:00 UTC every Monday).
- You know how to run `gh aw compile` to regenerate a workflow's lock file.

## 🎯 What You'll Do

You'll learn how `gh-aw`'s plain-English [schedule syntax](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/) maps to GitHub Actions cron schedules. By the end, you'll know which fuzzy expression fits your workflow, how to verify the compiled cron value, and how agentic workflows differ from classic Actions YAML when it comes to scheduling.

## Cron in one minute

GitHub Actions stores schedules as **[cron expressions](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/)** — five fields: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`.

You do **not** need to write cron by hand for common cases. In `gh-aw`, you can write a [fuzzy expression](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/#fuzzy-schedules) like `daily on weekdays`, then let `gh aw compile` convert it for you.

## Fuzzy schedule reference

| Fuzzy expression | Example compiled cron | Best used when… |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `schedule: hourly` | `30 */1 * * *` | You want fast feedback while experimenting or monitoring something that changes often. |
| `schedule: every 6 hours` | `14 */6 * * *` | You want several updates per day without generating hourly noise. |
| `schedule: daily` | `49 23 * * *` | You need a standard once-a-day summary. |
| `schedule: daily on weekdays` | `50 11 * * 1-5` | The workflow matters during the work week but can stay quiet on weekends. |
| `schedule: weekly` | `20 4 * * 5` | You want a low-noise roundup or [audit](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/audit/)-style report. |

> [!TIP]
> `gh-aw` **scatters** schedules across different minutes or hours so not every workflow runs at the same time. Your compiled cron value may differ from the examples above — treat your own lock file as the source of truth.

## Verify the compiled cron after `gh aw compile`

Run:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

Then open the generated [lock file](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/compilation-process/) and look for the `cron:` line under `on.schedule`:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "50 11 * * 1-5"
      # Friendly format: daily on weekdays (scattered)
```

This is the exact schedule GitHub Actions will register for **your** workflow.

## When should you use raw cron?

Raw cron expressions belong in **classic GitHub Actions YAML** workflows — not in [agentic workflow](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) `.md` files. In an agentic workflow, always use a fuzzy expression; `gh aw compile` generates the cron value in the `.lock.yml` automatically.

If none of the fuzzy options match your exact timing need, choose the closest fuzzy expression. The fuzzy expressions cover the most common cadences, and the compiler scatters the exact minute and hour to avoid load spikes.

> In a classic Actions workflow you would write cron directly:
>
> ```yaml
> # classic-actions.yml (NOT an agentic workflow)
> on:
>   schedule:
>     - cron: "15 9 * * 1-5"
> ```
>
> In an agentic workflow `.md`, always use fuzzy syntax instead:
>
> ```yaml
> on:
>   schedule: daily on weekdays
>   [workflow_dispatch](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/triggers/#dispatch-triggers-workflowdispatch): {}
> ```

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] I can explain what a cron expression is at a high level
- [ ] I know which fuzzy schedule expression best matches my workflow cadence
- [ ] I know that `gh aw compile` turns fuzzy syntax into a concrete cron value in the `.lock.yml`
- [ ] I know where to look for the compiled `cron:` line after compilation
- [ ] I know that raw cron belongs in classic Actions YAML, not in agentic workflow `.md` files
