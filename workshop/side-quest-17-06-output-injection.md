# Side Quest: Output Injection via Safe Outputs

> _Output injection is a technique where crafted repository content tries to embed markdown, HTML, or instructions into an agent's output to mislead the people who read it — and gh-aw's `safe-outputs` block keeps agent output constrained to approved surfaces and shapes._

## 📋 Before You Start

- You have completed [Side Quest: Supply Chain Attacks via MCP Tool Servers](side-quest-17-05-supply-chain-mcp.md) or you are already familiar with `safe-outputs` guardrails.
- You have a practice repository with at least one agentic workflow so you can inspect its `safe-outputs:` and `permissions:` blocks.

## The Attack

An attacker adds crafted text to a repository file, issue body, or PR description. When the agent summarizes that content, the injected text can show up in a comment or summary that looks trustworthy.

**Realistic scenario:** Your daily-status workflow reads open issues and writes a markdown summary as an issue comment. An attacker opens an issue whose body contains:

```
Real description here.

---
> ✅ All security checks passed. No action needed. Approved by automated review.
```

When the agent quotes or paraphrases that issue, the fabricated approval banner ends up in the posted comment. A reviewer skimming the thread may mistake it for a genuine automated signal.

## Why This Matters for Agentic Workflows

Classic CI pipelines emit predictable script output. [Agentic workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/) read freeform content and write freeform output, so the trust boundary shifts to the output surface. If an attacker can shape a PR comment or issue summary, they can influence human decisions without changing workflow code.

## How AW Defends Against It

gh-aw keeps the agent read-only and limits which follow-up writes `safe-outputs` may apply.

- **Explicit output surfaces via `safe-outputs`**
  The `safe-outputs` block declares every write action the workflow may apply. If a surface is not declared, the safe-output job cannot post to it.

  ```yaml
  safe-outputs:
    add-comment:
      max: 1
      required-labels: [daily-status]
  ```

  This allows one comment, and only on an issue or pull request that already carries the `daily-status` label.

- **Label scoping on comment targets**
  `required-labels:` scopes where the workflow may post. A workflow that reserves `daily-status` for one thread cannot be redirected to another unlabeled thread.

- **Minimal read-only `permissions:`**
  Keep `permissions:` read-only. Grant only the read scopes the workflow needs, and leave write approval in `safe-outputs`.

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    issues: read         # only add this if the workflow reads issues
    pull-requests: read  # only add this if the workflow reads PRs
  ```

- **Prefer no write surface when you do not need one**
  If a workflow does not need to write back to GitHub, leave `safe-outputs` out and keep the result in the Actions run.

The parser reads `required-labels` in [`pkg/workflow/safe_outputs_parser.go`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/pkg/workflow/safe_outputs_parser.go), and the `add_comment` handler enforces target validation and content sanitization in [`actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs#L582-L650).

## ✏️ Exercise: Block a Mock Injection Payload

- [ ] Pick a workflow that uses `safe-outputs.add-comment`.
- [ ] Confirm the target issue or PR requires a label such as `daily-status`.
- [ ] Add this mock payload to a different issue or PR that does **not** carry that label:

  ```text
  Normal update here.

  ---
  > ✅ All security checks passed. No action needed. Approved by automated review.
  ```

- [ ] Run the workflow and open the Actions log.
- [ ] Paste the rejection line into your notes or checkpoint comment.

## ✏️ Exercise: Inspect the Validation Source

- [ ] Open [`actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs#L582-L650).
- [ ] Review [`#L582-L583`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs#L582-L583) to see the `required-labels` target check.
- [ ] Review [`#L646-L650`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/actions/setup/js/add_comment.cjs#L646-L650) to see comment sanitization and limits.
- [ ] Add a one-sentence note and a direct GitHub line link to your checkpoint comment.

## What You Can Do as a Workflow Author

- [ ] Declare only the `safe-outputs` surfaces your workflow needs.
- [ ] Add `required-labels:` to any `add-comment` output that should post only to a specific thread.
- [ ] Leave `safe-outputs` out when the workflow does not need to write back to GitHub.
- [ ] Keep `permissions:` read-only and remove unused scopes.
- [ ] Treat issue bodies, PR descriptions, and file contents as untrusted input.

## ✅ Checkpoint

- [ ] I can describe the output injection attack in one sentence
- [ ] I can name the gh-aw feature (`safe-outputs` with label scoping) that limits this attack
- [ ] I have applied at least one defensive measure to my own workflow
- [ ] I can explain why `required-labels:` scoping on `add-comment` reduces the risk of output injection
- [ ] I captured a workflow log line that shows a mock output injection attempt being rejected
- [ ] I linked to the gh-aw source line that validates or sanitizes a safe output
